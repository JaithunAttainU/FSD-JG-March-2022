    The way to do it is piecemeal. You could just sit down and try reading Roberts's History of the World cover to
    cover, but you'd probably lose interest. I think it's a better plan to read books about specific topics, even if you
    don't understand everything the first time through.<br />

    Here are the most exciting ones I can think of:<br />

    Clark, Civilisation<br />
    White, Medieval Technology and Social Change
    McEvedy, Penguin Atlases of Ancient and Medieval History
    Laslett, The World We Have Lost
    Bernal, The Extension of Man
    Franklin, Autobiography
    Girouard, Life in the English Country House
    Pirenne, Mohammed and Charlemagne
    Runciman, The Fall of Constantinople
    Cipolla, Guns, Sails and Empires
    Hadas, A History of Rome
    Oman, The Art of War in the Middle Ages
    Vasari, Lives of the Artists
    Bovill, The Golden Trade of the Moors
    Caesar, Gallic Wars
    Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution
